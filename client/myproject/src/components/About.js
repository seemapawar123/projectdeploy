        <p id="pg">Maharaja Ranjit Singh was born, on November 13th, 1780. He was proclaimed as Maharaja of Punjab on April 12th 1801. He, like his father Sardar Mahan Singhji and mother Raj Kaur, was a very devoted Sikh. He always followed the Sikh code of conduct. He was a great warrior; democrat, philanthropist and patriot. He integrated the MISLS (small states) into a secular powerful Punjab and thus negated the saying of Afghans, "Grass never grows where Afghan horses have trodden." Although crowned king, he refused to wear the emblem of royalty and wore a simple turban. He also refused to sit on the throne. The coins did not bear his name or image. The Will of people was given great regard. Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were equal before law and had equal rights.

        Maharaja, as a real democrat helped educational and religious institutions of all communities. He never neglected the code of ethics even in the time of trouble of war. Maharaja Ranjit Singhji, the Lion of Punjab and a great patriot expired on June 27th, 1839 of a paralytic attack.
        
        To perpetuate the memory and ideals of this Great Son of India, Maharaja Ranjit Singh College of Professional Sciences has been established in 1994 by the Indo Friends Foundation, Indore. The Indo Friends Foundation is a voluntary, non political, non profit making organisation registered with the Government of M.P. as a public trust. Inspired by the great patriot and democrat, the Lion of Punjab - Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his immense love for education, the foundation named the Institute as "Maharaja Ranjit Singh College of Professional Sciences".
        
        The Management of the College has dedicated members who are experts in their fields and are committed to develop the Institute as a centre of excellence in Professional Sciences. Our Sister Concerns are Guru Harkrishan Public School, Mata Gujri Girls' Public School, Mata Gujri College of Professional Studies, Guru Gobind Singh Institute of Technology and Science.</p>
